# Finite-State-Machine
About building a simple Finite State Machine that will detect 4b patterns as its input from a stream of 4b packets. Here at every positive edge of the clock CLK, it samples a 4b input vector from the input port x [3:0] into the machine. Before we talk about the detector, we need to understand how a simple finite state machine works. A Finite State Machine are most widely used sequential logic circuit that contains a predefined number of states. The machine can exist in one and only one state at a time, and the circuit makes transition between states based on a triggering event, for example the positive edge of the clock with the values of any inputs of the machine. Using the states and predefined sequence of transitions, the circuit is able to make decisions on the next state to transition based on the history of past states. So in this lab we try to create a simple Finite State Machine that can detect a 4b pattern from its input. First we will try to write Verilog module that has an input vector ‘x [3:0]’ and an input ‘CLK’ and an output ‘z’ that sets to ‘1’ if it detects the pattern ‘1011’ in each 4b packet it receives at the input ‘x’.
